# Cobblemore
Cobblemon is missing a lot of competitive items. This mod addresses that.
Its unfinished and ugly, as most of the sprites are just resized sprites from bulbapedia

## What does it add?
Cobblemore adds many held items that aren't present in base Cobblemon including:
- Eviolite
- Life Orb
- Expert Belt
- Air Balloon
- Focus Sash
- Flame/Toxic Orb
- Weakness/Blunder Policy
- Red Card
- Eject Button/Pack
- Damp/Heat/Smooth/Icy Rock
- Terrain Extender
- Misty/Electric/Grassy/Psychic Seed
- Metronome
- Shell Bell
- Loaded Dice
- Wide/Scope/Zoom Lens
- Throat Spray
- Room Service
- Protective Pads
- Covert Cloak
- Utility Umbrella
- Shed Shell

It also adds the Ability Capsule and Ability Patch items for changing abilities.  
The shoal shells and shoal salt are added to craft the shell bell. They are both randomly dropped by sand, like how flint is obtained from gravel.

Certain items are missing methods to obtain them in survival. These include:
- Weakness/Blunder Policy
- Loaded Dice
- Throat Spray
- Shed Shell
