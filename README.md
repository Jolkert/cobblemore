# Cobblemore
Cobblemon is missing a lot of competitive items. This mod addresses that. Its unfinished and ugly, as the sprites are just straight rips from Bulbapedia, but that's slated to change in the future

## What does it add?
Cobblemore adds many items that aren't present in base Cobblemon including:
- Eviolite
- Life Orb
- Expert Belt
- Air Balloon
- Focus Sash
- Flame/Toxic Orb
- Weakness/Blunder Policy
- Red Card
- Eject Button/Pack
- Damp/Heat/Smooth/Icy Rock
- Terrain Extender
- Misty/Electric/Grassy/Psychic Seed
- Metronome
- Shell Bell
- Loaded Dice
- Wide/Scope/Zoom Lens
- Throat Spray
- Room Service
- Protective Pads
- Covert Cloak
- Utility Umbrella
- Shed Shell

## What does it *not* add?
Currently, ***there is no way to obtain any of these items in survival mode***  
This *is* a planned feature, however, and if you have any suggestions for methods, feel free to either submit a feature request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jolkert/cobblemore/issues), or make a request in [my discord server](https://github.com/Jolkert/cobblemore/issues)
